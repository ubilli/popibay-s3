This Laravel 4 package extends the built in Twitter Bootstrap styled pagination slider HTML markup to provide Zurb Foundation styled pagination slider HTML markup.

## Installation

Begin by installing this package through Composer. Edit your project's `composer.json` file to require `binarix/foundation-pagination`.

    "require": {
        "laravel/framework": "4.0.*",
        "binarix/foundation-pagination": "dev-master"
    }

Next, update Composer from the Terminal:

    composer update

Once this operation completes, the next step is to add the service provider. Open `app/config/app.php`, and add a new item to the providers array.

    'Binarix\FoundationPagination\FoundationPaginationServiceProvider',

The final step is to reference one of the the pagination styles. Open `app/config/view.php`, and modify the pagination item in the array.

For normal style use:

    'pagination' => 'foundationpagination::slider',

For centered style use:

    'pagination' => 'foundationpagination::slider-center',

That's it! You're all set to go.

## Usage

Just use pagination as you would normally and the markups generated for the links will be styled for Zurb Foundation framework.
